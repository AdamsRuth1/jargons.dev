An SRS (Software Requirements Specification) is a document that describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform. The SRS document serves as a guideline for developers and stakeholders throughout the software development lifecycle, ensuring that everyone has a clear understanding of what the software will deliver. 
The SRS document is always written by the User/Client and the developer.
